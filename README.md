# Angular Module Generator

> This [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) generator lets you quickly generate a new module for an Angular CLI Project in an opinionated module breakdown.

## Usage

### Angular

To run this generator, first you need an `@angular/cli` generated project.

Install the `@angular/cli` by running

```terminal
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

If you don't have an Angular project generate one.

```terminal
ng new my-fancy-project
```

<small><strong>*See [Angular CLI docs](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki) for more info on generating Angular artifacts.</small></strong>

### Yeoman

Install `yo` and `generator-slant` globally by running

```terminal
npm i -g yo generator-slant
```

Then from the root of your Angular project run

```terminal
yo slant
```
